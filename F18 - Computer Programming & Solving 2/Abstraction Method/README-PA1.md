# Programming Assignment 1

This repository is used as a way to provide to students
a starting point for CSC 220 Programming Assignment 1,
as well as a way to turn in the assignment.
Programming Assignment 1 is based on
[Programming Project](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9781284141092/sec10_10_7_html#sec10-10-7)
55 from Chapter 10 of the textbook,
as developed within the framework of this repository.
Some additional directions:
+ The package structure started in the repository must be followed, including both the names and contents of the packages.
+ Each java and xml file must have an appropriate header comment, including the student's name, email address, and the date of submission.
+ Comments within the existing classes in the repository provide specific directions that also must be followed.
+ You should clone this repository to a folder on your network drive (i.e., your H drive), then create a new local branch named
pa1-*your-mountunion-email-name*.  For example, I would create a branch named pa1-weberk.

Programming Assignment 1 is due Friday, September 14 at class time.
You will turn the assignment in by pushing your branch to GitHub. **Note Well:** this will not be possible until class time of the day that it's due, and it will *only* be possible to do this during class that day.
