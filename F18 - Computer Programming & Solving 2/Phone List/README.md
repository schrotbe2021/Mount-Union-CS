# Programming Assignment 3

This repository is used as a way to provide to students
a starting point for CSC 220 Programming Assignment 3,
as well as a way to turn in the assignment.
Programming Assignment 3 is basically Programming Project
100 from [Chapter 12](https://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/java/9781284141092/chapter-10-object-oriented-programming-part-3-inheritance-polymorphism-and-interfaces/ch10_html#X2ludGVybmFsX0h0bWxWaWV3P3htbGlkPTk3ODEyODQxNDEwOTIlMkZzZWMxMl8yMF83X2h0bWwmcXVlcnk9Qk9PSw==) of the textbook.
Notes:
+ The starting point code distributed in this repository lays out the package structure of the project.  **Do not** change the package names nor delete the existing classes; if you need to add classes, put them in one of the three packages provided.
+ You will need to research on your own how to use the JavaFX `ListView` control.  Remember that I have added several links in the [Resources](https://silver.mountunion.edu/cs/csc/CSC220/Fall2018/#resources) section of the course web page.


Your score will be based on the following rubric:

Programming Assignment 3 is due Wednesday, October 24, at class time.
You will turn the assignment in by pushing your branch to GitHub. **Note Well:** this will not be possible until class time of the day that it's due, and it will *only* be possible to do this during class that day.
